## Steps to Onboarding as a New Storyteller in the Speakeasy

### Roles
* Ensure you've given yourself the @Storyteller role in [#Channels and Roles](<https://discord.com/channels/260074028600000513/customize-community>). 
* If you want to be notified when we do sprints in #writing-sprints, also add the @Sprinter role.

### AO3 Collection
If you write on :ao3: *Archive of Our Own,* we've created a [collection](<https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Storytellers_Speakeasy>) to help cross-promote each other's works.

[Here's a guide](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KAJwBsrBE43gL3ylqYRa3tEs0TtMoPMenrEtc6p8K4s>) for how to add your work to the collection.

You'll need an invite to the collection; message @Royalty if you don't have one and we'll get you all set.

### Author Profiles
Add a post in #introductions and tag yourself with the `storyteller` tag. Use the [Author Profile template](<https://bullshit.go>) to get you started.

### The Library
Add your works to #the-library! Use the [Story Post template](<https://more.bullshit.go>) to get started. Remember, only post once per *series* (or *work*, for stuff that isn't part of a series) here.

### Live Reader Reactions
Whenever you drop a new chapter, make a post in #live-reader-reactions! This is a centralized place for people across fiction platforms to coalesce around, discuss, and support your work!

### Tell People!
Next time you drop a chapter update, let your readers know in an author note that you've joined the Storytellers' Speakeasy, and it's a fabulous place to come hang out! Here's a sample note to help:

***You're Invited to the Storytellers' Speakeasy!***

Hey, everybody! I've joined the [Storytellers' Speakeasy](<https://discord.gg/speakeasy>), a rapidly-growing community of writers and their fans on Discord. In the Speakeasy, my readers can interact with me and our community, see previews, beta read, or just hang out and discuss my work. Authors can find support with writing, researching, editing and promoting their content.  

The Speakeasy is a safe and supportive environment for all people, including and especially LGBTQIA+ folks of all stripes, and a sex-positive space. All NSFW content is separately moderated and hidden behind an opt-in role. We have active fandom discussions for Ranma 1/2, My Little Pony, Star Trek, Pokemon, Sailor Moon and several others, plus channels for gaming, writer support, trans/gender/LGBTQIA+ stuff, and more. 

Whether you're a Storyteller in your own right, want to participate in shaping my future content, or just want to hang with us in a supportive and welcoming community, you're welcome to join us!
